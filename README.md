# Flag-Classifier
Uses a SVM to classify flags and make predictions about test flags.

The model makes pretty good predictions most of the time and any time it makes a mistake in identifying a flag, the prediction won't be too far off of what it should be.

# Accuracy
The model currently has an accuracy of 69.04%, which is an improvement from the previous 59% after a change in the way the accuracy function worked.

# Future Changes
Fixing the coloring issue could help improve the accuracy of the model as it often confuses flags that have similar colors.
