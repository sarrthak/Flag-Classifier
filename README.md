# Flag-Classifier
Uses a SVM to classify flags and make predictions about test flags.

The model makes pretty good predictions most of the time and any time it makes a mistake in identifying a flag, the prediction won't be too far off of what it should be. For example, a common error it makes is in distinguishing between the Latvian flag and the Austrian flag.

# Accuracy
The model currently has an accuracy of 90.4%.
